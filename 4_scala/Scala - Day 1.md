Scala - Day 1
===

Overview
---

* Runs on the JVM
* Bridges gap betwen OOP and FP - general purpose
* Statically typed
* Type inference
* Immutable variables
* Advanced programming constructs - concurrency actors, higher-order functions on collection 
* Strongly typed! Compile-time type checking

Functional Programming
---

FP programs composed of functions
Functions always return a value
Functions are idempotent
Immutable state/data - Scala still allows mutable data
(Immutable state aids concurrency by ensuring two competing threads cannot change the same data)
