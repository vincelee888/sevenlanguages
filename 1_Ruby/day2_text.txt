David Cameron has defended a letter urging senior Muslims to explain how Islam 'can be part of British identity', amid criticism from leaders.

The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) criticised some aspects of the letter, including the 'implication that extremism takes place at mosques'.

Mr Cameron said the letter, written by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, was 'reasonable, sensible and moderate'

The letter was sent to 1,000 Muslim leaders after the attacks in Paris.

The prime minister said Mr Pickles was 'absolutely right' to write the letter urging leaders to do more to tackle extremism.

'Anyone who reads this letter - and I've read the letter - will see that what he is saying is that British Muslims make a great contribution to our country, that what is happening in terms of extremist terror has nothing to do with the true religion of Islam,' he said.

'It's being perverted by a minority who have been radicalised.'

David Cameron: 'I think it's absolutely right to write this letter'
'Proud of your country'
In the letter sent to more than 1,000 Islamic leaders, Mr Pickles stressed he was 'proud' of the way Muslims in Britain had responded to the Paris terror attacks but added that there was 'more work to do'.

He wrote: 'You, as faith leaders, are in a unique position in our society. You have a precious opportunity, and an important responsibility, in explaining and demonstrating how faith in Islam can be part of British identity.
